# challenge2final

## Description

This is the final version of challenge 2. It includes all of module one's lessons along with all of module two. The "grid" component was added as a means to better structure the site as I was able to clean up the code significantly because of this. I'll use this as a means to add projects and build a portfolio so that I can include it in my resume as a means for work that I've completed.
